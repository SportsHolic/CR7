		<h1>Unlucky Ronaldo!</h1>
		<p>
		Everyone know that Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the greatest soccer player ever in the history.But the recent time is not going well for him.last year he lost his newly born son facing hassels with ManUtd coach Erik Ten Hag, his open specch in a show against his own club ManUtd and the coach.everything was not going well at that time.but people guess that he will leave the club he were made of again.Then the world cup started.unfortunately in the quarter final match Portugal coach Fernando Santos didn't let him play. CR7 was in the bench.In quarter final Portugal lost against Morocco by 1-0 and Portugal was out from the 2022 world cup.Probably Cristiano Ronaldo played his last world cup.After the world cup CR7 joined the saudi pro league club Al Nasser in a record transfer of 200 million for 2 years.
